# Profile Analysis Code Repository

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for profile analysis using a dataset from "Profile_Analysis.xlsx". The code includes data exploration, visualization of missing values and outliers, analysis of numerical variables, data cleaning, and implementation of a linear regression model.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/profile-analysis.git
cd profile-analysis
```

2. Place the "Profile_Analysis.xlsx" file in the root directory.

3. Run the code:

```bash
python code.py
```

## Code Structure

- **Data Loading and Information Display**
  - Load the dataset using pandas from "Profile_Analysis.xlsx".
  - Display basic information and descriptive statistics of the dataset.

- **Checking Missing Values**
  - Check for missing values in the dataset.
  - Visualize outliers using box plots.

- **Analyze Variables**
  - Analyze numerical variables by creating histograms.

- **Data Cleaning and Model Implementation**
  - Separate features (X) and the target variable (Y).
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Impute missing values in numerical columns using mean.
  - Implement a linear regression model.
  - Predict on the test set and evaluate the model.
